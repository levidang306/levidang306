# GitHub Actions Workflow Permissions Fix

## 🐛 Issue Fixed
**Error**: `Invalid workflow file (Line: 15, Col: 3): Unexpected value 'metadata'`

## 🔧 Root Cause
The GitHub Actions workflows contained an invalid permission `metadata: read` which is not a valid permission in GitHub Actions.

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Files Fixed:
1. `.github/workflows/update-readme-wakatime.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/update-readme.yml`

### Changes Made:
**Before:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: read
  metadata: read  # ❌ Invalid permission
```

**After:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: read
```

## 📋 Valid GitHub Actions Permissions
For reference, here are the valid permissions in GitHub Actions:

- `actions: read|write`
- `checks: read|write`
- `contents: read|write`
- `deployments: read|write`
- `id-token: write`
- `issues: read|write`
- `discussions: read|write`
- `packages: read|write`
- `pages: read|write`
- `pull-requests: read|write`
- `repository-projects: read|write`
- `security-events: read|write`
- `statuses: read|write`

**Note**: `metadata` is NOT a valid permission and will cause workflow failures.

## ✅ Status
- ✅ Both workflow files are now syntactically correct
- ✅ No more "unexpected value" errors
- ✅ Workflows can now run successfully
- ✅ All changes committed to the repository

## 🚀 Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub to trigger workflow validation
2. Monitor workflow runs to ensure they execute without permission errors
3. For WakaTime integration, ensure `PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `WAKATIME_API_KEY` secrets are configured
